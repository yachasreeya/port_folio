						About Me :

				<p>
					As I said, I am your friendly
					neighbourhood osm developer...
				</p>
				<p>
					I am a passionate self taught developer
					(which is quite a subjective thing as i learnt from
					teachers on youtube so does that really counts?
					idk). I am having an experience of about 4 years
					and had a deep understanding of creating web products.
